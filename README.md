# password-generator-pops

This project consisted in creating code to generate a password that could include a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128.

When a user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, the application asks how many characters would like for its password to include. If the user chooses a number less than 8 and more than 128, an alert would come up explaining that the range length must be within the aforementioned parameters.

Once the user types a number within the correct range, the application asks if the user desires to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters and numbers. 

Based on the user's preferences, the application will generate a randomized password that matches its request.
